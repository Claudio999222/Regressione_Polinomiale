# Polynomial Regression Analysis

In this notebook, we will explore polynomial regression on a dataset. The primary approach involves transforming the feature data by constructing a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial transformation aims to capture non-linear relationships within the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to fit complex patterns.

## Key Steps:

1. **Polynomial Transformation**: We will perform a polynomial transformation on the feature data, creating a fourth-degree polynomial.
2. **Model Training**: The transformed data will be used to train a polynomial regression model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: We will assess the performance of the polynomial regression model using relevant metrics.
4. **Visualization**: Visual representation of the fitted polynomial and model predictions.

By incorporating polynomial regression, we aim to address non-linear relationships present in the dataset. The exploration of higher-degree polynomials provides a more flexible modeling approach, capturing intricate patterns that may be overlooked by linear models.

Feel free to delve into the code and accompanying explanations to gain insights into the process of polynomial regression and its application to the given dataset.
